          Whether you’re trying to get into the college of your dreams or aiming to score
          a job interview, it’s important to get your writing checked. College admissions
          officers pour through thousands of personal statements, and recruiters skim
          through countless resumes. By having a dedicated editor, you can focus on
          content and leave the technical details to me.

  Hi there,

  You’re probably here because you are looking for help with proofreading, editing, or with navigating the English language in general. Just to give you some background about myself, I received my BA in English and my MA in Education at the University of California, Irvine. More recently, I have attained my MBA from NYU’s Stern School of Business.

  I find joy in learning about people through their writing, and encourage them to delve deep into their thoughts and create an engaging piece. Moreover, I am meticulous when it comes to catching grammatical errors and creative when it comes to turning banal language into something beautiful.

  <br>
  <br>
  Not only am I extremely efficient with editing texts (from personal statements to aspiring novels to thoughtful blogs), but I am quick with my turnaround (your paper will be edited within 24 hours).

  E-mail me at <a href="mailto:Lili@TheElegantEditor.com"> Lili@TheElegantEditor.com</a> to get started today!
